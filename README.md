# TDSM RenWorld Plugin
Renames a world.

## About
A simple plugin to rename your world. I found myself in need of this before, so I made it since it was really simple. It's also a good plugin for an example to learn from if just learning Lua and/or TDSM Plugins. Feel free to submit a pull or fork it.

## Note:
Please be careful in your naming, it doesn't yet check for illegal characters or length. YOu could crash the server or corrupt your world! If you want some checks, put them in! :)

## How To Install
copy the RenWorld.lua file into the Plugins directory in your TDSM directory.

## How To Use
Type `renworld "New World Name"` to simply rename the world. And you could add `-filename` at the end to also rename the world filename.
