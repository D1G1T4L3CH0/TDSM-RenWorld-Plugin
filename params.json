I found myself in need of this before, so I made it since it was really simple. It's also a good plugin for an example to learn from if just learning Lua and/or TDSM Plugins. Feel free to submit a pull or fork it.\r\n\r\n## Note:\r\nPlease be careful in your naming, it doesn't yet check for illegal characters or length. You could crash the server or corrupt your world! If you want some checks, put them in! :)\r\n\r\n## How To Install\r\ncopy the RenWorld.lua file into the Plugins directory in your TDSM directory.\r\n\r\n## How To Use\r\nType `renworld \"New World Name\"` to simply rename the world. And you could add `-filename` at the end to also rename the world filename.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
